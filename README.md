# Programmable Voice Communication Layer

A programmable communication layer that enables AI agents to interact with users through natural, real-time voice conversations.

This project provides a foundation for building voice-first AI systems where agents can listen, understand, respond, and adapt dynamically in human-like dialogue.

## Overview

The Programmable Voice Communication Layer bridges artificial intelligence with natural voice interaction. It allows developers to build AI agents capable of seamless spoken conversations across platforms and environments.

The system is designed with low latency, flexibility, and agent-driven communication logic, making it suitable for both experimental and production-grade voice applications.

## Features

- Natural, real-time voice conversations  
- Programmable interaction flows for AI agents  
- Agent-oriented and modular architecture  
- Low-latency audio streaming  
- Multi-platform support (web, mobile, bots, devices)  
- Extensible for custom AI models and APIs  
- Secure and privacy-aware communication layer

## How It Works

1. User speaks through a supported interface  
2. Voice input is captured and streamed in real time  
3. Speech is processed and interpreted  
4. AI agent generates a contextual response  
5. Response is converted into natural speech  
6. Audio is streamed back to the user instantly
